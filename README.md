This Full Stack Appointment Booking System is built to help both individual doctors and hospitals effectively handle appointments and user management. It features three levels of authentication — for patients, doctors, and administrators — ensuring secure access and clear role-based control.

Patient Portal: Patients can sign up, log in, schedule appointments with available doctors, and conveniently manage their bookings.

Doctor Dashboard: Doctors can access their dashboards to view upcoming appointments, track their earnings, and update their personal and professional information.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators have complete control over the platform, allowing them to manage doctor accounts, oversee appointments, and maintain the integrity of system data.

Overall, this project provides a reliable, secure, and seamless communication channel between patients, doctors, and administrators — delivering a comprehensive solution for healthcare appointment management.
